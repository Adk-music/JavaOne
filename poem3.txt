Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
Oâ€™er the hills we go
Laughing all the way.
The bells on bobtail ring
The making our spirits bright
Oh what sport to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonig
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way!
O what joy it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
